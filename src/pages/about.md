「不系之舟」取自《庄子·杂篇·列御寇》中的「巧者劳而智者忧，无能者无所求，饱食而遨游，泛若<span style="color:orange; text-decoration: underline dashed; text-decoration-color: black;">不系之舟</span>，虚而遨游者也。」

我有一只暹罗猫，很黏人，它的名字叫闪电。

=======
AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I designed and crafted this based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme is aimed to be accessible out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by
default and additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. So, see the documentation for more info.
